Designed by [@benjsperry](https://twitter.com/benjsperry).\n\nNote: All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Drifty, nor vice versa.\n\nVisit [ionicons.com](http://ionicons.com) and  check out the search feature, which has keywords identifying common icon names and styles. For example, if you search for “arrow” we call up every icon that could possibly be used as an arrow. We’ve also included each icon’s class name for easy copy/pasting when you’re developing!\n\nWe intend for this icon pack to be used with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), but it’s by no means limited to it.
